`create-react-app helloworld` this method doesnt work with version 1.5.2

create-react-app version 1.5.2

this is the work around
`create-react-app hello-world --scripts-version=react-scripts@1.1.4 `

# Notes

## Tutorial 3: Folder Structure

`package.json` this file contains the dependencies and the scripts required for the project. Based on whether we use `yarn` or `npm` as package managers we are going to see `yarn.lock` and `package-lock` json files. .gitigonore and [README.md](http://readme.md) file is also present.

`node-modules` is a folder that stores all the dependencies. It is created when the `create-react-app` is run.

`public` folder contains three files. `manifest.json` is concerned with progressive web apps.

We have to concentrate on the `index.html` file. It is this file that is changed dynamically. React controls the ui through the `root` tag.

`src` is the folder that we will be using. In `index.js` we specify the root component which is the `app` component and the dom element which will be controlled by react. The dom element in our example is an element with an id of `root`.

`App.js` is the file that is responsible for displaying the content in the browser.

`App.css` is responsible for styling.

`App.test.js` contains simple test cases.

`index.css` applies styles to the `body` tag.

`serviceWorker.js` is concerned with progressive web apps.

When the command `npm start` or `yarn start` is run, the `index.html` file which contains the `root` dom node is served in the browser. Next the control enters the `index.js` . The react dom renders the app component on the root dom node. The app component contains all the other components which are rendered to html which is displayed in the browser.

## Tutorial 4: Components

In react component represents a part of the user interface. Component's are reusable and can contain other component.

The component file is placed in a js file. We can also use a jsx file structure for the purpose. 

There are two types of component:

- Stateless Functional Component - its a function like js function.
- Stateful Class Component - regular es6 class which have a render component

## Tutorial 5: Functional Components

Functional components are just js functions, they optionally receive `object` or properties which is called `props` and returns `html`. The html is known as JSX.

We use [Pascal case](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) for component file naming.

## Tutorial 6: Class Components

They are basically ES6 classes. They can also receive optional `props` . Apart from that they can also maintain private internal state.

### Functional Component

- Simple functions receiving props and returning a declaration
- Use them as much as possible
- Advantage: Absence of 'this' keyword
- Solution without using state
- Mainly responsible for the UI
- Stateless/Dumb/Presentational

### Class Component

- More feature rich
- Maintain their own private data
- Complex UI logic
- Provide lifecycle hooks
- Stateful/ Smart/Container

## Tutorial 7: Hooks Update

- No breaking change.
- Complete opt-in and 100% backwards-compatible.

## Tutorial 8: JSX

- JavaScript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JS language syntax.
- Write XML - like code for elements and components.
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children.
- JSX is not a necessity to write React applications.
- JSX make code simpler and elegant
- JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers.

### JSX Differences

Class → className

for → htmlFor

camelCase property naming convention

- onclick → onClick
- tabindex → tabIndex
